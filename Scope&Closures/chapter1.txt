Where do variables live? Where are they stored? how does our program find them
when we need them?

These questions speak to the need for a well-defined set of rules for storing
variables in some location, and for finding those variables at a later time.
We'll call that set of rules: Scope.

#Compiler Theory

compilation consists of,

1) Tokenizing, or Lexing

  breaking up a string of characters into meaningful chunks, called tokens.

  *tokenizing vs lexing = stateless vs stateful

2) Parsing

  taking a stream(array) of tokens and turning it into a tree, which represents
  the grammatical structure of the program. AST = Abstract Syntax Tree.

3) Code-Generation

  Process of turning AST into executable code.

JS snippets are compiled right before it is executed.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Understanding Scope

executing var a = 2; involves

  1) Engine: responsible for start to finish compilation and execution of our
  JS program.

  2) Compiler: handles parsing and code generation

  3) Scope: maintains a look-up list of declared variables and enforces
  a set of rules at to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

Compiler lexes, and parses code into AST, and when it gets to code-generation,

  when it gets to "var a" compiler checks scope. (if declared already, ignore,
  if not, tell scope to declare one for the current scope.)
  then the compiler produces code for "a = 2" assignment for the engine to
  execute.
  the code engine runs will first check scope for variable a(if variable
  exists, then assigns 2 into a, if not, throw un error.)

To summarize: First, Compiler declares a variable (if not already declared
in current Scope), then, when executing, Engine looks up the variable in Scope
and assign to it, if found.

**LHS look-up: find the variable container itself for assignment(target)
**RHS look-up: retrieve the value(source)

ex.

function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );

RHS: foo(..), a(in console.log)
LHS: a(parameter)

**not foo in the function declaration. variable declaration and function value
definition is handled by compiler during code-generation. therefore when
engine is executing code, there is no need for the Engine to assign the
function value to variable foo.

Quiz.

function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );

have a conversation as Engine, and identify LHS, and RHS

Engine: I have LHS reference for 'c', ever heard of it?

Scope:

LHS: a, var b, var c
RHS: a, a, b, foo

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Nested Scope

If a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, Engine consults the next
outer scope, continuing until the global scope.

ex.
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
}

var b = 2;

foo( 2 ); // 4

Engine: hey scope of foo, I have RHS for b, ever heard of it?
Scope: nope, look elsewhere.
Engine: hey outer scope of foo(global scope), I have RHS for b, ever heard?
Scope: yup, here ya go.

Resolve RHS and LHS with scope look-up chain.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Errors

RHS and LHS behaves differently when a variable cannot be found in any consulted
scopes.

RHS: ReferenceError
LHS: the global scope makes declares the variable and hands it to the Engine.

in strict mode, both throws ReferenceError.

#Review

RHS: looking up for retrieving value
LHS: looking up for assigning value

LHS results from assignment. (= or function parameter)

var a = 2;

first: var a (declaration in that scope, happens before code execution)
second: a = 2; (assignment)
