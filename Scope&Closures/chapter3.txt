Scope consists of a series of "bubbles" that each act as a container or bucket,
in which identifiers(variables, functions) are declared. These bubbles nest
inside each other, and this nesting is defined at author-time(write time).

#Scope from Functions
Each function you declare creates a bubble for itself.

any variables that are outside of current scope is accessible but they are
hidden if it is inside non parent scope.
