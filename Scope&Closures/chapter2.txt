What is Scope?
-a set of rules that govern how the Engine can look up variable by its
name, and find it in either the current scope or in any of the nested scopes
it is contained within.

#Lex-time

Lexical scope is scope that is defined at lexing time.
Lexical scope is based on where variables and blocks of scopes are authored,
by a programmer, at write time, and thus us set in stone by the time it has
finished lexing.(other name is static scope).

#Review
Lexical scope means that scope is defined by author-time decisions of where
functions are declared.
The lexing phase of compilation is essentially able to know where and how all
identifiers are declared, and thus predict how they will be looked-up during
execution.
