#Conditionals

to make a decision, you need to first consult the state.

different ways to express conditionals

1) if-statement ("If this condition is true, do the following...")

ex.
var bank_balance = 302.13;
var amount = 99.99;

if (amount < bank_balance) {
	console.log( "I want to buy this phone!" );
}

if statement requires a boolean expression in between parentheses.

you can provide an alternative if the condition isn't true, called else clause

ex.
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 302.13;
var amount = 99.99;

amount = amount * 2;

// can we afford the extra purchase?
if ( amount < bank_balance ) {
	console.log( "I'll take the accessory!" );
	amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
}
// otherwise:
else {
	console.log( "No, thanks." );
}

values that aren't already of an expected type are often coerced to that type.
pass something other than boolean into the if-statement's condition, it will
be coerced into boolean.

coerced "falsy" : 0, "",
coerced "truthy" : anything other than "falsy"

2) switch statmement

switch statment can be used as a shorthand for series of if-else statements

3) Loops

Loops use conditionals to either keep going or stop.
